Abstract:
Tropical Cyclones are large scale storms that occur in tropical conditions. A cyclone collects and carries large amounts of energy and water over its path on the ocean and can cause tremendous amounts of damage to life and property while it approaches the coast. It can also travel a long distance onshore, dissipating rainfall and causing significant damages.
Hurricanes are one such type of tropical cyclone which form over tropical or subtropical waters.  Hurricanes are simply the regional name for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Northeast Pacific Ocean east of the dateline, or the South Pacific Ocean east of 160E. In order for a hurricane to form, ocean waters must be at least 27℃ (80℉), an unstable atmosphere due to temperature differences, moist atmosphere, 200 miles from the Equator, and have little vertical wind shear. Vertical wind shear is defined as the rate wind changes in speed or direction with increasing altitude.
Understanding the velocity field distribution is an important component in assessing the strength and potential damage in hurricane research. Modeling a realistic velocity field distribution is fundamental to subsequent hurricane research such as lateral and vertical mass flow with the hurricane. This project is an effort of modeling a hurricane velocity field by decomposing the vector field into various simpler components. The overall velocity field can then be obtained by superimposing these simpler fields. We also demonstrate how this modeled velocity field can be used to calculate the mass influx at the base of a hurricane.  Mathematica is used to demonstrate the modeling process.
